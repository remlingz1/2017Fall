This is a game for in class

Hello, my name is Zack.  This paragraph will most likely be short as I am still fairly new to programming. I have worked mostly with java through Computer science 1 and 2.  As well as working with html and css. Other than computer science 1 and 2 I have also taken Discrete math for computing, and I am currently taking Assembly language and computer architecture, Algorithms, and Foundations of Data Science. So far my main topic of interest has been working on encryption programs, as it is both an interesting subject and one of the more popular topics of the day.

Judging by the description of the class, and the information that w will be going over; I do no think that I could state what I plan to use the information gotten in this class for.  The wide range of topics, as well as the vastness of the internet would mean that I would use the information for whatever situation  comes up. For one, being able to create a solid interactive web page is often considered a standard for any programmer. Regardless of whether one is looking for a job as a web page designer or not the ability to write a web page can never be underestimated. Furthermore I hope to use the ability to access databases to help in my foundations of data science class in order to gather new and perhaps more interesting data.
